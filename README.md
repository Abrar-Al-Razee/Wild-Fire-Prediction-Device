Wildfires are among the most destructive and unpredictable natural disasters. They lead to the loss of vast areas of forests, wildlife, and human property, costing millions of dollars. Relying solely on satellite monitoring is inadequate, as fires can spread rapidly before they are detected. Additionally, patrolling is often ineffective and unsafe, while drone monitoring can be costly and time-consuming. Approximately 85% of wildfires in the U.S. are initiated by human activities, such as unattended campfires, debris burning, equipment malfunctions, discarded cigarettes, or arson. Natural causes include lightning, underground coal fires, and rare events like meteor strikes.

This device takes data from the environment and bases its decisions on that data. It is used to predict if there is a chance of a wildfire or not
